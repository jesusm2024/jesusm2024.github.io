                        Launched a multi-tier cloud-native application (PhotoApp) using AWS EC2, S3, and RDS, incorporating a Node.js
                        and Express-based web service layer to handle API interactions for user and image management. Created a Python
                        client to interact with the web service, enhancing security and modularity by managing access through the service
                        layer. Deployed the web service with AWS Elastic Beanstalk, streamlining the provisioning of EC2 instances and
                        exposing APIs to external clients.
