            <h2>Overview: </h2>
            <p class="project-desc">
                Designed and developed a multifunctional alarm clock in collaboration with a peer. The clock was created to challenge the user to perform various tasks, such as reaching a target heart rate or solving trivia questions, in order to turn off the alarm. The project required integrating several hardware components, including an LCD screen, joystick, heartbeat sensor, and a Micro:bit microcontroller. The focus was on hardware-software integration, where custom driver code was written to interface with each sensor and component, ensuring seamless functionality. We also managed the budgeting, purchasing of materials, and adhered to a strict timeline for development and presentation.

                    <li>Set Alarm with Joystick: Users could set a timer using the joystick, with confirmation via a click.</li>
                    <li>Randomized Alarm Challenges:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Heart Rate Task: Users had to increase their heart rate by 10% above their baseline within 30 seconds.</li>
                        <li>Arrow Sequence Memorization: Users had to input a series of arrows correctly using the joystick.</li>
                        <li>Math Trivia: Users solved a math problem by selecting the correct answer using the joystick.</li>
                        <li>General Trivia: Similar to math trivia but with general knowledge questions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Failure Handling: If a user failed a challenge, the alarm would reset, requiring them to redo the task.</li>

                    <li>Led brainstorming, development, and testing for challenges to shut down alarm.</li>
                    <li>Coordinated meetings to guarantee we were on track to finished project before the deadline while still satisfying constraints.</li>
                    <li>Created outline for the code of each sensor by writing the header files and establishing the logic of each sensor as well as the main logic loop.</li>

                <ul class="project-desc">
                    <li>LCD Screen Integration: The most difficult part of the project was writing the code to initialize the LCD screen and render characters correctly. This required deep understanding of the screenâ€™s documentation and trial-and-error to get the display working.</li>
                    <li>Pin Configuration: Determining the correct pins on the microcontroller for each sensor and component was tricky due to inconsistent documentation. We solved this through experimentation and by consulting hardware documentation for guidance.</li>
                    <li>Hardware Connectivity: Connecting multiple sensors to a single breadboard required careful planning to avoid interference between components. We documented our wiring configuration thoroughly to mitigate issues.</li>
