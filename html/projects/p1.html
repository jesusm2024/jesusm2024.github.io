            <h2>Overview: </h2>
            <p class="project-desc">
                A Unity-powered strategy game built with C#, challenging players to take control of a node-based battlefield by strategically managing resources and directing their army. Players click and drag to send troops from their controlled nodes to enemy nodes, aiming to conquer the majority of the map. Upgrades and an adaptable enemy AI add depth, including a growth boost for faster unit production and an attack upgrade for increased battle effectiveness. Developed in a team of three, we handled the game logic, enemy AI, and animations.

                <ul class="project-desc">
                    <li>Multi-node attacks allow players to click and drag over multiple nodes to launch a coordinated assault on a single enemy node.</li>
                    <li>Adaptive AI behavior responds to the playerâ€™s actions, becoming more aggressive as the player upgrades and expands.</li>
                    <li>Multiple maps with distinct node arrangements challenge the players to strategically expand based on army positioning.</li>
                    <li>Growth and attack upgrades force players to weigh the risk of temporarily disabling a node against long-term advantages while also deciding whether to prioritize faster army growth or stronger frontline attacks. </li>

                <p class="project-desc">
                    My primary role was shaping the game's functionality and logic, contributing key ideas during team meetings to ensure a cohesive design. I fully developed and programmed the power bar that tracks army dominance and created the upgrade explanation displays. I collaborated on enemy AI behavior, helping determine when it should attack, reinforce, or upgrade. Additionally, I designed all visual elements, including node art, upgrade icons, and the animated robot that represents troop movement.

                <h2>Challenges: </h2>
                <ul class="project-desc">
                    <li>Aligning on a clear direction for the game was challenging since each team member had a different vision, making it difficult to decide what to keep, remove, or merge.</li>
                    <li>Version control proved to be a recurring issue. While using GitHub helped, working on different parts of the game simultaneously often led to frustrating merge conflicts.</li>
                    <li>Frequent demos meant constantly evaluating feedback, forcing us to decide what changes were worth implementing and what to disregard.</li>
                    <li>Debugging was an ongoing challenge, as some issues only surfaced in rare, specific situations, requiring creative problem-solving to identify and minimize them.</li>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <ul class="project-desc">
                <li>Collaborating with the team emphasized the need to balance individual contributions while ensuring that different parts of the game, including code, art, and AI systems, integrated smoothly.</li>
                <li>Developing adaptive AI systems and refining game mechanics deepened the knowledge of game design, particularly in balancing strategic decisions to ensure a challenging yet fair experience.</li>
                <li>Designing and animating assets, such as the nodes and troop movement robot, demonstrated how art and animations can significantly enhance the overall gameplay experience.</li>
