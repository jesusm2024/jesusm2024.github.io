            <p class="project-desc">
                This project showcases a collection of creative, animated, and interactive artwork and tools built using p5.js. The portfolio includes various animated gifs, brushes, particle systems, adjustable objects, and masks, all created with the purpose of exploring creativity and expression through code.

                <h2>Role: </h2>
                <ul class="project-desc">
                    <li>Sole Developer: Took ownership of the entire development process, from initial concept ideation through to coding, testing, and deployment of each interactive project in the portfolio.</li>
                    <li>Creative Design & Implementation: Designed and coded all interactive elements using p5.js, ensuring that each project—from animated gifs to particle systems—was both functional and visually engaging.</li>
                    <li>Debugging & Iteration: Identified and solved bugs related to rendering performance and unexpected behavior in particle systems and interactive elements.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Challenges: </h2>
                <ul class="project-desc">
                    <li>Unexpected Particle System Behavior: Initially, none of the particle systems worked as expected, so you iterated on the design by experimenting with forces and interactions until the systems evolved into something you were satisfied with.</li>
                    <li>Customizable Parameters for Objects and Masks: Creating customizable spaces and masks required a balance between flexibility and usability. You implemented several controls to adjust parameters, allowing users to create custom versions of objects like unicorns or masks.</li>
                    <li>Secondary Motion with Masks: Designing responsive secondary motion in the masks (like face contour tracking and shadow following) posed a challenge, but you solved this by leveraging tracking data to add realistic movement.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <ul class="project-desc" id="takeaways-box">
                <li>Creativity through Code: Through this project, you discovered how code can be used as a medium for art. You learned how to combine basic elements like shapes, colors, and transformations to create complex visual effects and interactive experiences.</li>
                <li>Modularity and Flexibility: One key takeaway is the power of modular design—by creating adjustable parameters, you allowed users to interact with and modify your artwork, adding an extra layer of engagement and creativity.</li>
