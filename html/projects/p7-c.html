            <h2>Overview: </h2>
            <p class="project-desc">
                Build an interactive 3D environment that showcases various lighting models and shading techniques using WebGL. Users can explore this environment while dynamically adjusting the position of a light source and observing how different materials respond to lighting effects. The project features side-by-side comparisons of Gouraud and Phong shading techniques, enabling users to see the differences in rendering quality and realism. The interactive interface includes controls for managing lighting properties, material settings, and the overall scene dynamics.

                <ul class="project-desc">
                    <li>WebGL: Utilized for rendering the 3D scene, creating geometries, and managing lighting calculations. </li>
                    <li>JavaScript: Handles user interactions, event listeners, and updates to the 3D scene based on user input.</li>
                    <li>HTML5 Canvas: Serves as the platform for displaying the interactive 3D environment in the browser.</li>
                    <li>Matrix Transformations (glMatrix.js): Employed for handling transformations and camera movements within the 3D space.</li>
                    <li>GLSL Shaders: Custom shaders for implementing lighting models, material properties, and shading techniques.</li>

                <h2>Features: </h2>
                <ul class="project-desc">
                    <li>Interactive Light Source: Users can control the position of the light source in 3D space using sliders for the X, Y, and Z axes, allowing real-time adjustments and immediate visual feedback.</li>
                    <li>Shading Techniques: The project implements two shading techniques:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gouraud Shading: Calculates vertex colors and interpolates them across polygons.</li>
                        <li>Phong Shading: Computes lighting at every pixel for a more detailed and realistic appearance.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Material Properties: Users can toggle between different material settings (e.g., matte, shiny) to see how they affect the appearance of objects under different lighting conditions.</li>
                    <li>Dynamic Scene Updates: The scene updates in real time based on user interactions, showcasing the effects of lighting and material changes immediately.</li>
                    <li>Side-by-Side Comparison: A dual viewport allows users to compare the results of Gouraud and Phong shading techniques simultaneously.</li>
