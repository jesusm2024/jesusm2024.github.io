            <h2>Overview: </h2>
            <p class="project-desc">
                Developed software for monitoring and analyzing various aspects of a vehicle’s performance through a series of interconnected sensor boards under the Data Acquisition System (DAQ) subgroup. The DAQ system normalized and transmitted sensor data via the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, allowing other systems to track vehicle conditions like temperature, wheel speed, and brake pressure. The project included modular boards for each key system and a logger board for data storage and analysis. The primary goal was to gather reliable sensor data for real-time performance monitoring and analysis.

                <ul class="project-desc">
                    <li>Modular System: The DAQ system consisted of multiple daughter boards (e.g., wheel speed, brake pressure, temperature) designed for specific functions. Each board measured and transmitted data to CAN</li>
                    <li>Each board collected sensor data, applied dimensionalization algorithms, and sent the processed data onto the High Priority (HP) or Low Priority (LP) CAN bus.</li>
                    <li>Data Logging: The Logger Board read data from the CAN bus and stored it on an SD card for later analysis.</li>
                    <li>Flexible Design: The system was designed for scalability, with over 10 daughter boards, allowing for simpler electrical harness manufacturing and reliable data readings.</li>
                    <li>Advanced Sensor Interpretation: Non-linear sensor data was processed using interpolation techniques such as quadratic or cubic spline fits.</li>

                    <li>Learning the CAN Library: One major challenge was learning how to use the CAN library effectively for transmitting and receiving data across various boards. To overcome this, I spent time understanding the protocol and performing tests to ensure data integrity and compatibility across the system.</li>
                    <li>Understanding Sensor Boards: To ensure accurate data collection, I had to thoroughly test and understand each sensor’s behavior, from wheel speed to brake pressure. This required careful experimentation, building custom test rigs, and iterating on the dimensionalization algorithms.</li>
                    <li>Hardware Coordination: Coordination with the hardware team was critical to ensure that the software could operate with the physical sensor boards. I had regular check-ins with the hardware team to discuss prototype availability and clarify expected sensor behaviors.</li>
                    <li>Documentation and Code Structure: Given the complexity of the system and the cross-team collaboration, maintaining clean code and thorough documentation was essential. This ensured other team members could easily follow the logic and modify the system as needed.</li>
